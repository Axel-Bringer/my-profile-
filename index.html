       <h2>🏟 Why Do I Love Soccer ? ⚽️</h2>
       <p>
       It's a sport I've played with my friends since I was a kid. It is a team sport, so it requires team spirit and helps to build friendships. I have a lot of childhood memories attached to this sport, which is why I enjoy it so much. Moreover, I have been a fan of FC Barcelona since I was a child.

      <h2> Why Do I Love Travelling ? 🏝</h2>
       <p>
       I am naturally curious. I love discovering new places and meeting new people. I travel for an unusual experience and leave with new skills or knowledge. I believe each destination has unique teaching content. Plus, I'm eager to see beautiful landscape, so I'm willing to pay a fortune to see it.

      <h2> 🎬 Cinema and Music 🎵</h2>
        <p>
         As I mentioned above, I am curious by nature. This curiosity is also expressed in art fields such as music or cinema. I love these two arts simply because they allow me to be entertained and pass the time. They are highly developed arts. There is something for everyone and I think that is why I enjoy them so much.
